I am passionate about bioinformatics and programming. My scientific interests are sequence analysis, machine learning, and systems biology, which I try to combine to understand the complex interactions in biology.

My research
------
Why do organisms cooperate, instead of living solitarily? I am interested in this questions in relation to symbiotic associations between microbes and animals. Mostly, I focussed on insect symbioses, but I have worked on the human gut microbiota as well. To study these systems, I analyze next generation sequencing data and integrate this information in computational models. I am currently working at the [Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz](http://www.bio.uni-mainz.de/zoo/oekologie/277_ENG_HTML.php).

My games 
------
In my free time, I like to develop educational games, such as this one [here](https://euba.github.io/EvoGame/), which was developed for students to teach how ecological adaptations like camouflage, aposematism, and mimicry can establish in a population under the selective pressure of predation.
