I am passionate about bioinformatics and programming in R and Python. My scientific interests include sequence analysis, machine learning, and systems biology, which I like to combine to understand the complex interactions in biology and biomedicine.

My research work
------
In my research, I was working on various biological systems utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics). These complex datasets are high-dimensional in nature and require computational tools to analyze and make sense of. To this end, I developed and applied different methods in bioinformatics and machine learning to reduce this data to meaningful insights.

Nowadays, I have switched from academia to industry to apply my data analysis skill set to real-world problems and make an impact on the projects I am involved in.

Feel free to check out my publication page to read more about the research I was doing, go to the portfolio page to get some visual impressions, or check out my CV section to get to know what I am currently up to.

My games 
------
In my free time, I like to develop educational games, such as this one [here](https://euba.github.io/EvoGame/), which was developed for students to teach how ecological adaptations, like camouflage, aposematism, and mimicry, can establish in a population under the selective pressure of predation
