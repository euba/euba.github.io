I am passionate about bioinformatics and programming. My scientific interests are sequence analysis, machine learning, and systems biology, which I try to combine to understand the complex interactions in symbiotic communities. Additionally, I also like to develop small mobile games. 

My research
------
Why do organisms cooperate, instead of living solitarily? I am interested in this questions in relation to symbiotic associations between microbes and animals. Mostly, I currently work on insect symbionts, but I have worked on the human gut microbiota as well. To study these symbioses, I also develop software packages. I am currently working at the [Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz](http://www.bio.uni-mainz.de/zoo/oekologie/277_ENG_HTML.php).

In my free time, I like to develop educational games.
