I am passionate about bioinformatics and programming. My scientific interests are sequence analysis, machine learning, and systems biology, which I try to combine to understand the complex interactions in symbiotic communities. I also like to develop small mobile games with an educational focus. 

My research
------
Why do organisms cooperate, instead of living solitarily? I am interested in this questions for symbiotic associations between microbes and animals. Mostly I work on [insect symbionts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29153832), but I have worked on the [human gut microbiota](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30083388) as well. To study these symbioses, I also develop [software packages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28531184). I am currently working at the [Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz](http://www.bio.uni-mainz.de/zoo/oekologie/277_ENG_HTML.php).

My games 
------
In my free time, I like to develop mobile games. Mobile technologies are exciting and full of opportunities. Most of my games have an [educational focus](http://inople.com).
